A Boolean Algebra for Genetic Variants  

A set of Boolean relations: equivalence; containment, i.e., either a
variant is fully contained in another or a variant fully contains another;
overlap, i.e., two variants have (at least) one common element; and
disjoint, i.e., no common elements that allows for a comprehensive
classification of the relation for every pair of variants by taking all
minimal Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) alignments into account.
